The website is called __*Song Shuffler*__ and it allows the user to discover music from their favorite artist, or explore a recently found one, as well as learn about them and explore other related artists. The site takes an artist name and returns a random song, along with the lyrics, information about the artist and their top three albums, the most relevant YouTube video for the song returned, and some artists that are related (similar) to the one searched. In order to provide this functionality we used the **Youtube API** for the video, the **MusixMatch API** for the lyrics and the **last.fm API** for the bio and the pictures.
